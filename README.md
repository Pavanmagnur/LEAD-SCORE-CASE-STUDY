Problem Statement:
X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. X Education needs help in selecting the most promising leads, i.e., the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.
The company needs a model wherein you a lead score is assigned to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%

Goals : 
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

Case Study Approach:

For this case study, where the target, resultant outcome is either the lead will join the course or not. Since the resultant outcome is categorical in nature, we will use the logistic regression model to predict the potential lead based on the given data and check its accuracy and prediction power using certain metrics.
